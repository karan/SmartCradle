SmartCradle
===========

A bunch of stuff for babies of 2014

Pressure sensor to know when the baby has been put to sleep with chest down. Can cause Sudden Infant Death (SID). React by:

- Glowing red LED
- Sending signal to SmartThings to do stuff (lights, alarms etc).

### Stuff used:

- Arduino Duemilanove
- Tessel (for Wifi, I did not have the Wifi shield)
- Pressure sensor
- LED
- SmartThings
